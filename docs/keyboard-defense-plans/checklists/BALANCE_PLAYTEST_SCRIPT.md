# Balance playtest script (30-45 min)

## Session setup
- Player self-reports typing experience: novice / intermediate / advanced
- Run 1: play with default settings
- Run 2: play with reduced time pressure (if available), or normal

## Capture metrics
- Battles completed per run
- WPM and accuracy per battle
- Streak buffs triggered vs missed
- Gold earned per battle and per run

## Questions
1. Did you feel forced to type fast to survive?
2. Were drill instructions clear and readable?
3. Were defeats understandable (why did you lose)?
4. Did typing practice feel meaningful to the strategy?

## Tuning notes to record
- Threat rate feels too fast/slow
- Bonus gold feels too strong/weak
- Drill difficulty feels repetitive/too random
