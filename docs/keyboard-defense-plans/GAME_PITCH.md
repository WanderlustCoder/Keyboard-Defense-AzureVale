# Game pitch: Keyboard Defense (Godot)

## One-liner
A typing-first fantasy kingdom defense trainer where battles are won by clean
keystrokes, and campaign progress unlocks upgrades that make your typing power
feel tangible.

## Player fantasy
- "My typing skill protects the kingdom."
- "Accuracy and rhythm matter as much as speed."
- "Each battle shows measurable improvement, not just a score."

## Differentiators
- Typing is the primary input and core combat mechanic.
- Drill-based battles teach specific key sets and patterns.
- Campaign map plus kingdom upgrades create a long-term arc.

## Target platform / scope
- Windows desktop (Godot 4).
- Pixel-art fantasy presentation with high-contrast UI.

## Design pillars
1. Typing is the primary skill and the primary input.
2. Battles are paced for learning, not punishment.
3. Progression is clear: map -> battle -> rewards -> upgrades.
4. Accessibility and clarity over twitch mechanics.
