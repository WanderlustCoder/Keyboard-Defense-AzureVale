# Keyboard Defense (Godot) Plans Pack

Generated: 2025-12-23 (adapted)

This folder repurposes the external plans pack for Keyboard Defense. It keeps
focus on the current Godot project and avoids reusing the original project name.

Contents:
- Research notes on genre inspiration (high level only; no copying).
- Game pitch and design document tailored to the Godot loop.
- Balancing model and typing pedagogy.
- Architecture, tech stack, and data schema guidance.
- UX controls and battle intervention spec.
- Roadmap and Codex CLI workflow prompts.
- QA and balance playtest checklists.
- Asset creation pack for art and audio (see `assets/README.md`).
- Pre-production planning pack (see `preprod/README.md`).
- Extended planning pack (see `extended/README.md`).
- Business and delivery planning pack (see `business/README.md`).
