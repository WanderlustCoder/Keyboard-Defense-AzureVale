# Steam Asset Brief (Creative)

## Goal
Create store assets that are readable at small sizes and clearly convey:
- Kingdom building
- Night defense threat
- Typing-first identity

## Key Visuals
- Central icon: stylized castle or keep
- Foreground: a "typing prompt ribbon" motif (letters on a banner)
- Background: night silhouettes of approaching enemies

## Composition Rules
- Strong silhouette first; details second.
- Avoid tiny text; if you add words, keep them minimal and high-contrast.
- Ensure the title is legible at the smallest capsule size.

## Screenshot Requirements
- Show the command/prompt UI clearly in at least 2 screenshots.
- Include one "night wave" screenshot with readable threats.
- Include one "map/exploration" screenshot.
