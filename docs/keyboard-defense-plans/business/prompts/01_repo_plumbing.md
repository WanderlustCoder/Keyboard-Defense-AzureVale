# Codex Milestone - Repo Plumbing (Issue/PR Templates + Docs)

You are working in the Keyboard Defense repository.

## Objectives
1) Add the planning documents from this pack into `docs/keyboard-defense-plans/business/` with subfolders for `release/`, `marketing/`, `backlog/`, `research/`, and `templates/`.
2) Add GitHub issue templates and PR template under `.github/` if you decide to activate them in this repo.
3) Add a `CHANGELOG.md` based on `docs/keyboard-defense-plans/business/templates/CHANGELOG_TEMPLATE.md`.
4) Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` that points contributors to:
   - `docs/keyboard-defense-plans/business/DEFINITION_OF_DONE.md`
   - `docs/keyboard-defense-plans/business/templates/CODE_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`
   - How to file bugs, balance issues, or content requests

## Constraints
- Do not change gameplay code in this milestone.
- Keep docs in Markdown.
- Ensure paths match this pack's structure.
- Do not add new tooling dependencies without explicit approval.

## Acceptance
- `git status` shows added files in expected locations.
- No existing tests are broken (`.\apps\keyboard-defense-godot\scripts\run_tests.ps1` still passes if present).
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` contains bug, feature, balance, content, playtest forms.
