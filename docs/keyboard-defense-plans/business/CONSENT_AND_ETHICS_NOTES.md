# Consent and Ethics Notes (If You Run Studies or Collect Data)

This is not legal advice.

## When You Need Consent
- If you collect telemetry beyond local device storage
- If you recruit playtesters and publish results
- If you target minors or schools (extra requirements)

## Recommended Practices
- Plain-language consent screen
- Clear list of data collected and why
- Opt-out path that does not reduce core functionality
- Avoid collecting raw typed text unless essential; prefer aggregates

## Data Handling
- Secure storage for any uploaded data
- Limit access to the smallest set of people
- Define retention and deletion policy

## Reporting
When sharing results:
- aggregate only
- avoid small sample re-identification (k-anonymity thresholds)
