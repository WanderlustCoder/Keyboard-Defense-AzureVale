# Key Messages

## One-liner
A typing-first strategy roguelite: plan by day, explore for rewards, and defend at night while improving real typing skills along the way.

## Three Pillars
1. **Typing is your interface**: you command the kingdom by typing.
2. **Tactical day/night loop**: build and explore by day; survive waves at night.
3. **Adaptive learning**: difficulty adjusts to your skill so progress never hard-gates.

## Audience
- Players who like strategy/roguelites
- Students and lifelong learners
- Anyone who wants to improve typing without "drills"

## Differentiators
- Not a typing test skin: typing is integrated into strategy decisions.
- Accessibility-first: adjustable time pressure and practice options.
- Runs are short enough for repeat practice.
