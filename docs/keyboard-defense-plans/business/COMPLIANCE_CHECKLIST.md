# Compliance Checklist (Practical, Non-Legal)

This checklist is meant to prevent late rework. It is not legal advice.

## Accessibility (minimum)
- Typing time pressure adjustable
- Practice mode (no failure)
- Reduced motion option
- High contrast option
- Font size scaling
- Audio sliders (master/music/sfx) + mute
- Clear error messages and non-punitive input handling

## Privacy (recommended)
- No telemetry by default (opt-in)
- If telemetry exists:
  - data dictionary documented
  - local buffering; offline safe
  - easy opt-out
  - no collection of raw typed content unless explicitly disclosed and necessary

## Input
- Primary controls usable by typing-only
- Remapping support for keybindings used outside text entry (e.g., pause)
- Avoid conflicts with OS/global shortcuts

## Safety / Content
- Avoid harmful or inappropriate word lists in default wordpacks
- If user-generated wordpacks exist, provide filtering and reporting

## Licenses
- Third-party code licenses tracked
- Any generated assets are attributable to your own pipeline
- Fonts: confirm redistribution rights

## Platform Notes
- Steam/itch requirements may include specific disclosures and age ratings depending on content.
- Verify platform policies close to submission.
