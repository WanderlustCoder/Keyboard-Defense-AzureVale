# Assessment Protocol

## Baseline Test (5 minutes)
Purpose: estimate initial WPM/accuracy for adaptive difficulty.

Structure:
- 60s warm-up (not counted)
- 2 x 90s prompts (counted)
- 1 x 60s "focus keys" prompt set (counted)

Rules:
- No time pressure scaling in baseline; fixed timer.
- Use neutral vocabulary; avoid names and sensitive words.

Outputs:
- baseline WPM
- baseline accuracy
- dominant error type
- recommended difficulty preset

## Periodic Skill Checks
Trigger:
- after every 3 runs (configurable)

Structure:
- 60s short check using current curriculum focus

Reward:
- small cosmetic unlocks or meta currency
- avoid punishing low performance

## Study Mode (Optional)
If you run a formal study:
- ensure informed consent
- provide opt-out and deletion path
- avoid collecting raw typed text unless essential
