# Accessibility Compliance Notes

## Target
A typing game can be accessible if it offers:
- adjustable challenge
- reduced penalty modes
- readable UI and predictable timing

## High-Impact Settings
- **Time Pressure Scale**: multiplies prompt timers (0.5x-2.0x)
- **Error Tolerance**: strict/standard/lenient
- **Prompt Length Caps**: cap by difficulty; allow shorter prompts in accessibility modes
- **Reduced Motion**: disable screen shake, reduce particle counts
- **High Contrast UI**: alternative palette + thicker outlines
- **Font Options**: monospaced, dyslexia-friendly (if licensed), size scaling

## "No Hard Gate" Principle
Typing skill should influence efficiency and score, but should not hard-lock progression.
Examples:
- Failure reduces reward, not immediate run loss
- Provide alternative slower action path without timed prompt

## Testing
- Test with:
  - low WPM and high accuracy players
  - high WPM players
  - players with keyboard layout differences
  - players who prefer no timers
