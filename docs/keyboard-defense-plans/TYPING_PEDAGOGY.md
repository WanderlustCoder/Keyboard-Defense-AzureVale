# Typing pedagogy and adaptivity

## Objectives
1. Improve accuracy first, then speed.
2. Keep feedback positive and actionable.
3. Tie words to the fantasy defense theme.

## Current curriculum
Stage A - Home row foundations
- Keys: a s d f j k l
- Lessons: home-row-1, home-row-2

Stage B - Reach row warmup
- Keys: e r t u i o
- Lessons: reach-row-1, reach-row-2

Stage C - Upper row warmup
- Keys: w e r t y u i o
- Lessons: upper-row-1, upper-row-2

## Prompt generation rules (current)
- Lessons provide ordered word lists.
- Drills can shuffle and limit word counts per step.
- Targets drills can focus on short patterns or longer words.

## Adaptivity (planned)
Track:
- per-key error counts
- accuracy and WPM trend per battle
- frequent mistake bigrams

Use those signals to:
- select extra targets featuring weak keys
- reduce time pressure when accuracy drops
- offer optional drills with rewards for focused practice

## Feedback UX
Show:
- WPM and accuracy in battle
- short, non-punitive feedback on errors
- positive reinforcement on streaks and drill clears
