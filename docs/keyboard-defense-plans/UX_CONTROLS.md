# UX controls and input design

## Philosophy
- Typing is the primary interaction in battle.
- The UI should surface what to type and why it matters.

## Global conventions
- Keyboard-first: most actions are reachable without a mouse.
- Clear, short hints for each drill step.
- Avoid error spam; focus on calm, readable feedback.

## Battle controls (current)
- Type the target word to advance.
- Backspace removes the last typed character.
- ESC toggles pause.
- F1 opens the debug drill override panel.

## Map and kingdom controls
- Mouse or keyboard navigation for buttons and cards.
- Focus order should allow full keyboard traversal.

## Accessibility
- Larger font scale.
- Reduced time pressure toggle (planned).
- High contrast UI options (planned).
