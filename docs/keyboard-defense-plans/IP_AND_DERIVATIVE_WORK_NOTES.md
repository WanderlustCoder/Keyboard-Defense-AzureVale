# IP and derivative work notes (important)

Keyboard Defense is inspired by genre mechanics (campaign planning and defense)
that appear across many strategy games. To avoid IP issues:
- Do not reuse any external game art, audio, UI layouts, story text, or names.
- Use original setting, characters, and terminology.
- Do not look at proprietary assets or code.

Extra caution:
- Avoid sound-alike names and similar iconography.
- Keep UI layouts distinct and typing-first.
