Predecessor: `docs/MONOGAME_CAMPAIGN_M7_PLAN.md`

## Objective

Deliver final pre-release campaign polish and launch-readiness workflow alignment after M7 release-hardening completion.

## Scope

- Resolve remaining high-impact campaign UX polish items found during final sanity checks.
- Consolidate release notes inputs for campaign systems and telemetry-backed confidence.
- Lock repeatable RC verification workflow for pre-release and post-fix revalidation.

## Planned Workstreams

## M8-01 Final campaign UX polish pass

Status: Planned

- Execute a focused campaign map usability pass (readability, cue timing, edge-case clarity).
- Apply only high-value, low-risk polish fixes.
- Re-run campaign-focused sanity checks after each accepted polish fix.

## M8-02 Release notes + evidence packaging

Status: Planned

- Summarize campaign milestone outcomes (M1-M7) for release notes.
- Capture telemetry/checklist/test evidence references in one release-facing summary.
- Ensure artifact references remain current for RC and release handoff.

## M8-03 RC verification loop hardening

Status: Planned

- Define a short repeatable RC verification loop:
- package builds
- run campaign-focused sanity sweep
- confirm readiness checklist remains PASS
- Keep go/no-go criteria explicit and easy to re-run after any late fix.

## Out of Scope (M8)

- New gameplay system additions.
- Large campaign progression redesigns.
- Engine-level migrations or platform pipeline rewrites.
