# Status Notes (Legacy Web)
> Note: These status notes document the retired web version (`apps/keyboard-defense`). The current Godot project lives at `apps/keyboard-defense-godot`; use `docs/GODOT_PROJECT.md` and `apps/keyboard-defense-godot/README.md` for active workflows.

This folder is retained for historical context. Avoid updating these notes unless
you are linking new work back to the old web tasks.
