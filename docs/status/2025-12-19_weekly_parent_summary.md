## 2025-12-19 - Weekly Parent Summary

- Added a parent-friendly Weekly Summary overlay in the pause/options menu that highlights time practiced, average accuracy/WPM, combo peak, perfect words, breaches, drills, and repairs with a supportive coaching tip.
- Overlay ships with close/print controls, focus traps, aria labels, and print styling so parents can quickly download a PDF or review metrics without entering gameplay.
- HUD now refreshes the summary live from session analytics, and tests cover the overlay toggle plus metric rendering; Season 4 backlog item #65 marked Done.
