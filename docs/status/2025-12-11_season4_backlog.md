# Season 4 Backlog Kickoff - 2025-12-11
> Note: This document targets the retired web version (`apps/keyboard-defense`). The current Godot project lives at `apps/keyboard-defense-godot`; see `docs/GODOT_PROJECT.md` and `apps/keyboard-defense-godot/README.md` for active workflows.

## Summary
- Drafted `apps/keyboard-defense/docs/season4_backlog.md`, a 100-item mastery & engagement backlog for ages 8-16 (free, single-player, Edge/Chrome, pixel art, offline-friendly, no ads/accounts).
- Added `apps/keyboard-defense/docs/season4_backlog_status.md` with all items initialized to Not Started for a clean baseline.
- Linked the new backlog and status tracker from `docs/docs_index.md` so future work can reference and update them.

## Verification
- Docs-only change; open the new backlog and status files to review the items and baseline state.
