## 2025-12-18 - Collectible Lore Scrolls

- Added a Lore Scrolls panel + overlay that unlocks short reading snippets whenever lessons/typing drills are completed, with per-profile persistence and unlock logs.
- HUD sidebar and options menu now surface scroll progress (lessons completed, unlocked/total, next requirement) with a highlight when new scrolls appear.
- New lesson progress storage + scroll data helpers are covered by tests; Season 4 backlog item #64 marked Done.
