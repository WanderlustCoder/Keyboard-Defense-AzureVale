## 2025-12-17 - Companion Pet Sprites

- HUD gains a companion pet panel with a pixel sprite that shifts mood based on live performance: cheering on high accuracy/combos, happy on solid play, concerned when breaches/low health appear.
- Mood text/aria labels update alongside the sprite, and reduced-motion settings automatically soften the animation cadence.
- Tests cover mood transitions and the new DOM wiring; styles reuse castle skin variables so themes tint the pet card.
