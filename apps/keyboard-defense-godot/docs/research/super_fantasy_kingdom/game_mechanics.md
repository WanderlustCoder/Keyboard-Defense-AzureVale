# Super Fantasy Kingdom: Game Mechanics and Systems

Super Fantasy Kingdom blends city building, resource management and roguelike progression in a way that encourages experimentation.  It is described as a **roguelite city builder** with automatic defence battles and exploration【5124544752661†L27-L44】, combining multiple genres such as simulation, base‑building, auto‑battling and exploration【937127750608205†L42-L48】.

## Starting a run

At the beginning of a run, players choose a **faction**—initially Human, with Undead unlocked later—and are given a ruined castle, a handful of villagers and one hero【5124544752661†L27-L44】.  The goal is to **rebuild the kingdom** by gathering resources and constructing buildings.  Core resources include *food*, *wood* and *stone*; these are produced by assigning workers to buildings such as farms, sawmills and quarries【5124544752661†L27-L44】.  Gathering enough resources allows the construction of walls, towers, taverns and other structures【955100408868214†L28-L70】.

## Day–night cycle

A distinctive mechanic is the **day–night cycle**, which dictates the rhythm of play.  During the **day**, players expand the realm: they build structures, allocate villagers to gather resources and plan defences.  When **night falls**, waves of monsters attack.  These enemies become more numerous and powerful as days pass, forcing players to continually improve their defences【714652172019561†L91-L152】.  Galaxus emphasises that the alternating cycle of build‑up and defence is the heart of the game【714652172019561†L91-L152】, while MojoTop warns that neglecting the day–night rhythm can lead to collapse【656063226726299†L60-L97】.  After losing a run, players must start over, but the experience and unlocks gained carry forward in a roguelike fashion【955100408868214†L28-L70】.

## Resource management and production chains

Players manage workers and production chains to ensure a steady supply of materials.  Each building produces resources only when staffed, so **allocating villagers** effectively is crucial【5124544752661†L27-L44】.  As the settlement grows, production chains become more complex; for example, grain is milled into flour, which is then baked into bread to feed villagers and heroes【5124544752661†L27-L44】.  Running out of food deprives heroes of experience and slows down the economy, making resource planning essential【5124544752661†L62-L99】.

## Automatic battles and heroes

Combat in Super Fantasy Kingdom is **automatic**.  When enemies attack at night, heroes and units fight on their own; placement of towers and troops influences survival【5124544752661†L62-L99】.  Heroes are central to defence: each has unique abilities and can be recruited via **special events, random encounters or exploration**【937127750608205†L50-L77】.  After surviving a night, heroes retreat to the tavern to eat; the amount of food provided determines how much experience they gain, leading to level‑ups and stronger abilities【5124544752661†L62-L99】.  Recruitment and positioning of heroes and units are critical for lasting through increasingly large hordes.

## Exploration

Expanding the kingdom isn’t limited to building within the initial borders.  Players **build roads** to explore the map, discover new biomes and encounter quests, NPCs and hidden relics【5124544752661†L62-L99】.  Exploration often grants additional units or heroes and unveils new resources or upgrade opportunities.  SteamDeckHQ notes that players can recruit heroes and gather materials from events and exploration, adding variety to each run【937127750608205†L50-L77】.

## Meta‑progression and replayability

Like other roguelites, Super Fantasy Kingdom features extensive **meta‑progression**.  When a run ends, players earn rewards and permanent upgrades that can unlock new units, buildings, relics, heroes and biomes【5124544752661†L62-L99】.  The Epic Games Store article stresses that repeated failure leads to **new opportunities**, citing inspirations from *Hades*, *Loop Hero*, *They Are Billions* and *Dwarf Fortress*【955100408868214†L28-L70】.  With more than **100 different units and combinations**, the game encourages experimentation and deck‑building‑like strategies【955100408868214†L28-L70】.  Each subsequent run becomes slightly easier or offers more strategic options, motivating players to persist through difficult early attempts.
