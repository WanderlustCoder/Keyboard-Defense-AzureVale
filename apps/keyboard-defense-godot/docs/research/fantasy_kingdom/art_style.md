# Reference Art Style Notes (Fantasy Kingdom Roguelite)

Context: Research used to inform Keyboard Defense (Godot 4) UI and grid readability.
This is not the project name.

## Visual direction
- Retro pixel art with bright colors and readable silhouettes.
- Small castle focal point with compact building footprints.
- Clear resource and defense icons to minimize HUD clutter.

## Top-down isometric world
- Grid-based, isometric perspective to show buildings and paths.
- Clear tile edges for placement and defense lanes.
- Soft shadowing to separate tiles without losing readability.

## Inspirations
- Classic strategy look (Settlers/Stronghold era) with modern clarity.
- Cute, readable characters contrasted with darker environment effects.

## Minimal interface
- Keep the HUD lean: focus on resources, build commands, and day/night phase.
- Avoid menu clutter; highlight the build/defend rhythm.

## Image reference
- The research zip included a pixel-art castle PNG. It is not stored here to comply with asset rules.
