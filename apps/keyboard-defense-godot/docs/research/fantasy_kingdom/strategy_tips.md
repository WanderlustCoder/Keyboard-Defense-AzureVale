# Reference Strategy Notes (Fantasy Kingdom Roguelite)

Context: Strategy notes adapted as design inspiration for Keyboard Defense (Godot 4).

## Balance the day
- Gather and build early; shift to defense prep before night.
- Early walls and towers buy time for later expansion.

## Workforce and economy
- Keep food, wood, and stone production steady.
- Avoid overexpansion without matching defenses.

## Plan synergies
- Heroes and units complement tower types and defense lanes.
- Align upgrades with the most threatened approaches.

## Explore strategically
- Expand only when the economy is stable.
- Exploration increases options and threat; pace it deliberately.

## Embrace failure
- Use losses to unlock and refine strategies.
- Expect a roguelite loop that rewards learning.

## Application to Keyboard Defense (Godot)
- Provide feedback that links typing performance to defense outcomes.
- Encourage small, deliberate upgrades rather than sprawling builds.
