# Narrative and Content Bible

This document defines the tone, themes, and content constraints for Keyboard
Defense. It supports a typing-first strategy loop.

## Core fantasy
You are the steward of a learning fortress. By day you prepare upgrades and
train skills. By night you defend the gates with typed interventions. Your
words are your tools: orders, plans, and quick commands become typed actions.

## Tone
- Optimistic under pressure; hard days, hopeful people.
- Light humor allowed, never snark at the player for mistakes.
- Short lines. Clear nouns and verbs. Avoid long flourishes that slow typing.

## Themes
- Preparation vs improvisation
- Community resilience
- Learning through repetition and mastery
- Progress through calm practice

## Content constraints (edutainment)
- Avoid profanity and targeted insults.
- Avoid real-world politics, religion, hate, and graphic violence.
- Avoid slang unless a wordpack explicitly opts into it.
- Keep prompt text readable: target 35 to 80 characters for combat interventions.

## Pedagogy-driven language design
- Prompts are graded by:
  - length (characters)
  - punctuation density
  - rare letters (q, z, x, j, k)
  - hand alternation and common bigrams (th, he, in, er, an, re, on, at)
  - numbers and symbols (optional advanced packs)

### Prompt difficulty tiers
- Tier 0: home row + space only
- Tier 1: full letters, no punctuation
- Tier 2: simple punctuation (.,!?)
- Tier 3: apostrophes, hyphens, quotes
- Tier 4: numbers and mixed-case (optional)
- Tier 5: symbols (@#$% etc.) (opt-in only)

## Player-facing writing rules
- Use consistent verb forms for commands: "train", "upgrade", "reinforce", "scout".
- In battle phase, keep interventions as imperatives:
  - "raise gate"
  - "repair wall"
  - "focus archers"
  - "reinforce north"
- Always allow pause and practice commands.

## NPC groups (generic, original)
- The Hearthkeepers: food, morale, celebrations
- The Wardens: defense drills and watch duty
- The Scribe Hall: research and wordcraft upgrades
- The Wayfinders: exploration and scouting

## Biomes (original)
- Evergrove: dense woods, rich timber, muffled sound
- Stonepass: rocky ridges, ore pockets, slow travel
- Mistfen: wetlands, herbal caches, limited visibility
- Sunfields: open plains, fast movement, exposed lanes

## Reward loop language
Celebrate mastery:
- "Clean execution."
- "Orders carried out."
- "Precision pays."
Never shame errors:
- Replace "Wrong" with "Try again" or "Close - watch the punctuation."

## Acceptance criteria
- Every narrative element must be data-driven and localizable.
- Content must include tags for pedagogy: tier, letters, bigrams, punctuation.
- No content may reference specific existing games, characters, or trademarked terms.
