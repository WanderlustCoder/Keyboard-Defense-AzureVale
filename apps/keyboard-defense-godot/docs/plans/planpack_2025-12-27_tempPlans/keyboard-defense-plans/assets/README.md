# Keyboard Defense (Godot) - Asset creation plans

This folder adapts an asset planning pack to the current Godot project. It
focuses on original art and audio ideas only and avoids any external naming or
layout reuse.

Contents:
- Art style guide, asset list, and auto-tiling rules.
- Art pipelines (SVG to PNG and optional runtime generation).
- UI asset spec for scalable panels and prompt widgets.
- Audio event map, sound style guide, and procedural synth notes.
- Godot integration notes and asset agent rules.
- Codex asset playbook and milestone prompts.
- Asset QA checklist and schema references.
