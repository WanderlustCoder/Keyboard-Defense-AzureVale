# Playtest Plan (Typing-First Defense)

---
## Landmark: Objectives
1. Verify the core loop is fun, not just educational.
2. Measure whether typing mechanics teach skills without causing churn.
3. Validate difficulty adaptivity (does it feel fair?).

---
## Landmark: Participant profiles (minimum)
- A: beginner typist (self-reported < 25 WPM)
- B: intermediate (25-60 WPM)
- C: advanced (> 60 WPM)

Aim for 3-5 participants per profile for early feedback.

---
## Landmark: Session format (30-45 minutes)
1. Intro + consent (5m)
2. Tutorial + first run (10-15m)
3. Second run with at least one setting change (10-15m)
4. Debrief interview (5-10m)

---
## Landmark: Tasks to observe
- Can participant upgrade a kingdom option without help?
- Can participant start a battle and use a typed intervention?
- Can participant survive at least one wave?
- Do they discover help or command hints?

---
## Landmark: Metrics to capture
Quantitative:
- run length, day or battle count
- WPM and accuracy trend within session
- number of failed prompts per wave
- use of accessibility settings

Qualitative:
- perceived fairness of timers
- readability of threats
- enjoyment of map/kingdom phase vs battle phase

---
## Landmark: Stop conditions
If a participant becomes frustrated:
- suggest calm mode or time multiplier
- switch to practice mode where prompts cannot cause instant loss

---
## Landmark: Output artifacts
- Summary of issues by severity
- A prioritized backlog
- Adjusted difficulty curve parameters
