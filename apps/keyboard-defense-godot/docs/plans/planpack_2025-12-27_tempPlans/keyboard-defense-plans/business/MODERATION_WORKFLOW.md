# Moderation Workflow

## Intake
Sources:
- In-game report (if implemented)
- Community platform reports (Discord/Steam)
- Email

## Triage Categories
- P0: credible threats / doxxing / CSAM indicators -> escalate immediately
- P1: hate speech / harassment -> remove and action same day
- P2: spam -> remove
- P3: off-topic -> redirect

## Response Steps
1. Acknowledge receipt (if the reporter expects a reply).
2. Preserve evidence (screenshots/logs) internally.
3. Take action (remove content, warn, mute, ban).
4. Document in moderation log.

## Appeals
- Provide a single channel for appeals.
- Review within a defined window (e.g., 7 days).
- Keep decisions consistent.

## Data Handling
- Store the minimum data needed to enforce rules.
- Avoid public sharing of user identifiers.
