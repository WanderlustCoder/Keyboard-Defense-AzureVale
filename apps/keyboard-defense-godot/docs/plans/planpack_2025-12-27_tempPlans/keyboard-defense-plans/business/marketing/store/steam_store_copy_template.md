## Short Description (1-2 lines)
Keyboard Defense is a typing-first strategy roguelite: build by day, explore for rewards, and defend at night while improving real typing skills as you play.

## Long Description (Draft)
Type commands to run your kingdom. Gather resources, expand into the unknown, and prepare defenses before night falls. When the horde arrives, quick typing under pressure lets you repair breaches, trigger emergency actions, and turn the tide.

Typing skill matters-but it never hard-gates. Adaptive difficulty and accessibility options keep the game challenging without becoming punishing.
