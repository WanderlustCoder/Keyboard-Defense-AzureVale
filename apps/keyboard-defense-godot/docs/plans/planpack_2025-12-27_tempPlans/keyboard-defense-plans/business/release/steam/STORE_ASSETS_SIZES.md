# Store Asset Sizes (Verify Before Submission)

Platform asset requirements can change. Use this as a working list and verify against current Steamworks requirements.

## Common capsule assets (examples)
- Main capsule
- Small capsule
- Header capsule
- Library assets (hero, logo)

## Planning Notes
- Maintain a single master design (vector) and export required sizes.
- Ensure text is readable at the smallest capsule size.
- Avoid tiny UI details; use strong silhouette and 1-2 focal points.

See `docs/keyboard-defense-plans/business/STEAM_ASSET_BRIEF.md` for creative direction.
