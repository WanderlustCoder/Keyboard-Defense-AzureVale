# Steam Input Plan (Optional)

Only implement this if you intend to support controllers.

## Principle
Typing-first remains primary. Controller support is for accessibility only.

## Scope
- Basic navigation of menus
- Optional selection of commands via radial / palette
- No expectation that players can type on controller

## Testing
- Ensure controller cannot softlock the game (always accessible exit/back).
- Ensure prompts/time pressure do not assume keyboard presence.
