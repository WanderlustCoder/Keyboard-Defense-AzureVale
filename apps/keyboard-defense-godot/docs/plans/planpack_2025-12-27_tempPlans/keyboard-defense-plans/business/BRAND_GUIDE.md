## Positioning
A typing-first strategy roguelite where you build by day, explore for opportunities, and defend at night while learning real typing skills as you play.

## Tone
- Encouraging, not punitive
- "Skill-building" framed as empowerment
- Humor is light and non-sarcastic

## Visual Identity
- Readability first (monospace-friendly UI)
- Bold silhouettes for buildings/enemies
- Warm, inviting palette with a darker "night threat" accent
- Minimal clutter during prompts

## Copy Principles
- Use short sentences.
- Prefer verbs over adjectives.
- Avoid jargon in player-facing tutorial; keep jargon in advanced help.

## Naming Conventions (in-game)

- Systems are nouns: "Outpost", "Wall", "Workshop", "Threat Card"
