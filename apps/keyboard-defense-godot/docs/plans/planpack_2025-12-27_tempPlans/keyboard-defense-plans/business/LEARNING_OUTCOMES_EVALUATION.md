# Learning Outcomes Evaluation

## Goal
Demonstrate that the game improves typing skill in measurable ways, without requiring invasive data collection.

## Core Skill Metrics
Track (and optionally display to the player):
- **WPM** (words per minute)
- **Accuracy** (% correct characters)
- **Consistency** (variance of inter-key timing or WPM stability)
- **Error types** (substitution, omission, transposition, extra)
- **Backspace rate** (as a proxy for hesitation)

## Learning Objectives (example)
1. Improve home-row comfort and accuracy.
2. Reduce common error patterns (e.g., transpositions).
3. Increase sustainable WPM under mild pressure.

## Evaluation Strategy
Two-tier plan:

### Tier 1 - In-Game Progress (no external study)
- Baseline test at first launch (optional)
- Periodic skill checks every N runs
- Show trend lines to the player locally

### Tier 2 - Formal Study (optional)
- Pre/post design:
  - pre-test (5 minutes)
  - training period (e.g., 2 weeks)
  - post-test (5 minutes)
- Compare against control condition if possible:
  - game in "practice only" mode
  - or alternate typing app

## Success Criteria (examples)
- +5 WPM average improvement with no accuracy drop
- 20% reduction in targeted error types
- Reduced variance in timing during night prompts

## Reporting Outputs
- Player-facing:
  - weekly report cards (local)
- Developer-facing (opt-in):
  - aggregated anonymous stats
