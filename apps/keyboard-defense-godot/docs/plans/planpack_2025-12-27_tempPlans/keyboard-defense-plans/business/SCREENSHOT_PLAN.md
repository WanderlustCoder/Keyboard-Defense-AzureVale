# Screenshot Plan

Goal: 6-10 screenshots that communicate the loop quickly.

## Shot List (Recommended)
1. **Day overview**: resources + build options + command line visible
2. **Exploration map**: fog-of-war + POI discovered
3. **Building placement**: build command feedback + structure preview
4. **Night defense**: enemies approaching, wall status labels visible
5. **Emergency action**: repair command/prompt in progress
6. **Run recap**: WPM/accuracy report card + run summary

## Rules
- Always show the typing UI in at least half the shots.
- Avoid clutter; crop to emphasize the prompt and status.
- Use consistent font sizes and contrast settings.

## Capture Checklist
- Stable build version watermark (small)
- No debug overlays
- No placeholder textures (unless explicitly "in development")
