# itch.io Release Plan (High-Level)

This document is a durable baseline plan. Verify against current itch.io docs when you publish.

## Recommended Release Track
- Start with a **Windows build** for rapid iteration.
- Add macOS/Linux builds once stability is proven.

## Page Setup
- Clear description of:
  - typing-first controls
  - accessibility settings
  - minimum system requirements
- Provide controls summary at the top.

## Builds
- Desktop:
  - Zip per platform.

## Deployment Workflow (baseline)
- Use a consistent channel naming scheme:
  - `windows` / `mac` / `linux`
- Version each upload and keep changelog updated.
