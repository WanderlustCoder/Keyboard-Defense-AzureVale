# Incident Response Playbook (Lightweight)

## Triggers
- Security vulnerability report
- Data leak suspicion
- Widespread harassment/spam wave
- Inappropriate UGC circulating

## Immediate Actions
1. Confirm scope (what systems, what users, what data).
2. Mitigate:
   - disable UGC sharing temporarily (if possible)
   - rate limit uploads
   - patch critical vulnerabilities
3. Communicate:
   - brief public statement with what you know and what you are doing
   - avoid speculation

## Follow-Up
- Root cause analysis
- Preventive changes (validation, sandboxing, moderation tooling)
- Postmortem notes (internal; optionally public summary)

## Contact List
Maintain:
- owner contact
- moderator contacts
- platform contacts (Steam/itch support)
