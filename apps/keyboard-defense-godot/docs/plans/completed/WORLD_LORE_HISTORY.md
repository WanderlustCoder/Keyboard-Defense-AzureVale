The complete history, mythology, and lore of the Realm of Keystonia.

## The Creation Myth

### The First Words

*In the beginning, there was Silence.*

*The Void stretched infinite and empty, a realm of nothingness where no thought could form and no meaning could exist. But within the heart of the Void, a spark of intention flickered.*

*This spark became the First Typist - a being of pure creative will who reached into the emptiness and struck the first key. The sound echoed through eternity, and from that single keystroke, the letter 'A' was born.*

*The First Typist continued, each keystroke bringing forth a new letter, a new sound, a new possibility. When all twenty-six letters existed, they began to combine, forming the First Words. And the First Words had power.*

*"LIGHT" banished the darkness.*
*"LAND" rose from the void.*
*"LIFE" breathed into being.*

*Thus Keystonia was written into existence, letter by letter, word by word, a realm born from the ancient keyboard of creation.*

### The Home Row Covenant

The eight home row letters (A, S, D, F, J, K, L, ;) made a covenant to always support the typist. When fingers rest upon them, they provide grounding and stability. This is why the home row is taught first - it represents the covenant between typist and letters.

## Geography & Cosmology

### The Shape of Keystonia

Keystonia is shaped vaguely like a keyboard when viewed from above:

### The Void Beyond

Beyond the borders of Keystonia lies the Void - the original nothingness from which the world was typed. The Void Tyrant draws power from this emptiness, sending tendrils of Silence into the realm.

### The Shattered Isles

Above the world float the Shattered Isles - fragments of a land that was "deleted" by an ancient catastrophe. These islands hold secrets of the First Typist and can only be reached by those who achieve legendary mastery.

## The Typhos Horde

### Origin

The Typhos Horde was born from the collective frustration and abandonment of failed typists. When someone gives up on learning to type, their potential energy is consumed by the Void, spawning a Typhos creature.

### Hierarchy

| Rank | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| Drone | Typh-Spawn | Mindless, follows simple patterns |
| Soldier | Typh-Scout | Fast, weak, probing attacks |
| Elite | Typh-Raider | Standard enemy, moderate challenge |
| Champion | Typh-Armored | Tough, long words required |
| Commander | Typh-Lord | Mini-boss, leads waves |
| General | Typh-Champion | Zone boss |
| Overlord | Void Tyrant | Final boss |

### Corruption Effects

When the Typhos overwhelm an area:
- Words become scrambled
- Keyboards malfunction
- Typists lose accuracy
- Eventually, complete Silence falls

## Prophecies & Legends

### The Prophecy of the True Typist

*"When Silence spreads its wings once more,*
*And keyboards fall to Void's dark shore,*
*A champion shall rise anew,*
*With fingers swift and heart most true.*

*Through home row's path and reach row's height,*
*They'll type the words that banish night.*
*When all the keys have been mastered,*
*The Void Tyrant shall be shattered.*

*But heed this warning, young and bold:*
*Speed without soul leaves keys cold.*
*Accuracy alone is stone.*
*Balance is how thrones are won."*

### The Legend of the Perfect Sentence

It is said that somewhere in Keystonia exists the Perfect Sentence - a combination of words so powerful that typing it perfectly would reshape reality itself. The Void Tyrant seeks to destroy it before it can be found.

### The Secret of the First Typist

What happened to the First Typist? Some say they became the Ancient Keyboard itself. Others claim they still exist, watching, waiting for the True Typist to emerge. Elder Lyra knows more than she reveals...
