# Codex Summary Template

Use the following headings at the end of each milestone summary:

1) Milestone Goal
2) What Shipped (User-visible)
3) Plan Alignment
   - Which ROADMAP.md items this milestone advanced (cite section titles)
   - Any deviations (and why)
4) Current Project State (snapshot)
5) Roadmap Next (top 5 items, priority order)
6) Known Issues / Tech Debt (top 5)

Then include the standard LANDMARK block:
- LANDMARK A: Files added/changed
- LANDMARK B: How to run (commands)
- LANDMARK C: Tests/smoke results (paste key lines)
- LANDMARK D: Next prompt suggestion (what to implement next and why)

Checklist
- Update PROJECT_STATUS.md if features changed
- Update ROADMAP.md if priorities changed
- Update CHANGELOG.md every milestone
- Keep tests green
