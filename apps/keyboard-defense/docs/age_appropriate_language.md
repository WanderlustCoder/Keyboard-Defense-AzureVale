# Age-Appropriate Language Guidelines (Ages 8–16)

Use this as the single source of truth for in-game copy, tutorials, tooltips, taunts, and docs that surface to players. The audience is kids and teens; keep language clear, kind, and encouraging.

## Tone and Reading Level
- Aim for a friendly coach or mentor voice; avoid sarcasm or anything that sounds mean-spirited.
- Keep sentences short (10–16 words) and concrete; prefer active verbs.
- Avoid idioms, slang, or culture-specific references; keep it globally understandable.
- Never use negative labels for players (“bad”, “slow”, “lazy”). Focus on the action (“Try slowing down to hit every key.”).

## Safe Content Rules
- No mature themes (violence beyond light fantasy, politics, romance, horror, or gore).
- No references to real-world groups, religions, or current events.
- No first/last names; use role labels or auto-generated safe handles only.
- Prohibit profanity or near-profanity, even “mild” variants. Denylist common euphemisms.
- Keep taunts playful and about the scenario (castle/defense), never about the player personally.

## Style Choices
- Use “castle”, “defenders”, “typing”, “practice”, “combo”, “accuracy”, “focus” as primary nouns.
- Encourage effort: “Take a breath and try again.”; “Lock in the home row first.”
- Reward progress, not speed alone: “Great accuracy streak!”, “Combo holding steady.”
- Use gentle prompts for mistakes: “Missed a key—try tapping it slower.”
- For timers/goals, say “Let’s reach 2 minutes” instead of “Hurry up.”

## UI Copy Patterns
- Buttons: short verbs (“Resume”, “Practice”, “Retry”, “Launch drill”).
- Warnings: start with action and guidance (“Caps Lock is on—turn it off to keep accuracy.”).
- Success: name what happened and why it matters (“Perfect word! Shields drop faster.”).
- Failure/lose states: avoid blame; offer next step (“The castle fell. Try a shorter practice run or repair early.”).

## Taunts and Dialogue
- Keep taunts from enemies light and impersonal (“The walls look wobbly!”).
- Avoid mocking the player; any “trash talk” is about the castle state, not the player’s ability.
- Mentor/coach lines should include tips (“Reset your fingers on home row.”).

## Writing Checklist
- [ ] Reading level roughly grade 4–6; run copy through a quick readability check when unsure.
- [ ] No personal data, names, or ask for user input beyond the game UI.
- [ ] Encouraging framing; one constructive tip if possible.
- [ ] Passes profanity and denylist checks (see wordlist lints).

## Where This Applies
- HUD labels and tooltips.
- Tutorial steps and banners.
- Loading tips and break reminders.
- Enemy bios, lore snippets, and roadmap text.
- Taunts catalog and dialogue files.
