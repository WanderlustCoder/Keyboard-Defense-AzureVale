# HUD Implementation Notes
- Upcoming Enemies panel might eventually show storm icons.
- Consider animating lane badges when breaches happen.
- Turret slots now broadcast hover/focus events to the renderer so testers can see lane range overlays without placing a turret.
- Add accuracy delta badge when combo warning triggers.
