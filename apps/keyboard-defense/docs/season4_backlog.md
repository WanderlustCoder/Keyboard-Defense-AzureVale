# Season 4 Backlog - Mastery & Engagement (Ages 8-16)

Fresh 100-item backlog for the next wave of Keyboard Defense. Guardrails: ages 8-16, free single-player, Edge/Chrome, offline-friendly, no accounts/ads, and cartoonish pixel art for all sprites/castle pieces. Focus on deeper typing pedagogy, retention, safety, and polish.

## Adaptive Learning & Coaching
1. Diagnostic placement test per profile with hand-specific scores and pacing recommendations.  
2. Per-finger mastery tree that unlocks drills based on demonstrated accuracy and timing.  
3. Adaptive session goals (accuracy/WPM/consistency) that tune themselves after every run.  
4. Spaced-repetition scheduler for weak keys/digraphs, blended into lesson queues.  
5. Error-cluster detection that surfaces targeted micro-drills for the top three problem patterns.  
6. Keystroke timing profile (latency jitter, WPM bands) that gates spawn speed ramps.  
7. Fatigue detector (dropping accuracy + rising latency) that proposes short breaks.  
8. Personalized warm-up generator (5-minute) assembled from the last session’s mistakes.  
9. Post-run coach summary that highlights the biggest win, the biggest gap, and one suggested drill.  
10. Common shortcut/command practice (copy/paste/select/delete) tailored for safe kid-friendly tasks.  
11. Shift timing tutor with visual “hold vs tap” cues and slow-mo mode.  
12. Number-row and symbol focus modules with progressive unlocks and accuracy thresholds.  
13. Sentence-construction drills emphasizing punctuation and rhythm, not just isolated words.  
14. Reading-comprehension passages followed by quick quizzes typed in-line.  
15. Alternating-hand rhythm drills with metronome cues and gentle haptic/audio beats (when available).  

## Modes & Challenges
16. Daily quest board mixing drills and castle-defense tasks with kid-friendly language.  
17. Weekly mastery quest that culminates in a bespoke challenge wave.  
18. Time-attack sprint mode (60–90 seconds) with tiered medal thresholds.  
19. Calm focus lane mode: only one lane active for targeted practice.  
20. Ghost race against your own best wave/run (local replay only).  
21. Opt-in challenge modifiers (fog, fast spawns, limited mistakes) with clear scoring multipliers.  
22. Checkpointed campaign runs that offer mid-run upgrade or respec choices.  
23. Boss practice lab that overlays error heatmaps and hint bubbles.  
24. Reaction challenge mini-game that tests prompt-to-key latency.  
25. Combo preservation challenge where limited mistakes are allowed per segment.  
26. Typo recovery drills (undo/redo sequences) that appear mid-wave.  
27. Quick target selection drills where typed choices route support to lanes.  
28. Left- or right-hand isolation practice mode with curated word banks.  
29. Endurance marathon with scheduled stretch/water breaks and optional auto-pause.  
30. Seasonal event playlists with thematic wordlists and castle props (no monetization).  

## Castle, Enemies, and Mechanics
31. Modular castle rooms that grant buffs (library = accuracy, forge = fire-rate, garden = regen).  
32. Typed barricade building between waves with clear material costs.  
33. Resource drops that require short typed codes to claim mid-wave.  
34. Rescue events where captured defenders are freed via timed phrase sequences.  
35. Weather effects (wind/rain) that alter projectile arcs with accessible visual cues.  
36. Burrowing enemies that demand sustained hold/repeat key patterns.  
37. Mimic enemies that swap their word once per spawn with a fair warning cue.  
38. Shield generators that must be dismantled with long-form codes while lanes stay active.  
39. Siege engine miniboss with multi-stage typing locks and escalating prompts.  
40. Sneak enemies that hide letters until a scan word is typed to reveal them.  
41. Hazard tiles that trigger small penalties on mistakes, with clear “safe zone” signage.  
42. Lane-priority automation rules editable via typed macros (kid-safe presets).  
43. On-demand training dummy that can be spawned mid-run for DPS checks.  
44. Power phrases that temporarily overdrive turret fire-rate or splash radius.  
45. Defensive rune sockets on turrets configured via typed inscriptions.  

## UX, Accessibility, and Guidance
46. Adjustable HUD zoom for small displays and low-vision comfort.  
47. Left-handed UI layout flip that repositions critical panels.  
48. Dyslexia-friendly font/spacing presets auto-suggested during onboarding.  
49. Reduced cognitive-load mode that hides non-essential UI for younger learners.  
50. Focus outline presets and color themes tailored for keyboard navigation.

54. Large-text subtitles for mentor dialogue and cutscene panels.  
55. Adjustable tutorial pacing slider (slow/normal/fast text reveal).  
56. Input latency sparkline in the diagnostics overlay with warning thresholds.  
57. Profile-bound accessibility presets with a one-tap toggle.  
58. Screen-shake/intensity preview widget before enabling effects.  
59. Accessibility self-test mode that plays cues and confirms they are perceived.
